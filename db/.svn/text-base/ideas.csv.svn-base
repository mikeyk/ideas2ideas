1. Automated timers or other devices to turn on/shut off different things.  For example, the new air conditioners I've seen often have a turn-on timer, so I can turn it off in the morning and set it to start up a half hour before I get home from work.  Similar ideas could be used on heaters, interior and exterior lighting, etc.
2. Better window materials, if developed, could save money in a couple of ways.  First, it would effectively make heaters/air conditioners more efficient with good insulation.  Second, if windows didn't represent ports through which warm or cold air would come in, and if they had better privacy abilities (one-way without being mirrored, perhaps), houses could include many more windows and skylights.  This additional natural light would reduce the need for daytime lighting that exists in my house at least.  Some rooms have insufficient windows to provide sunlight, and the others face a major road and need to be covered for noise and privacy reasons, so we've always got lights on in order to read, even in the daytime.",

1-Solar energy panels mounted on roofs and used for power / heating can save homeowners plenty of money as well as lessen the use of non-renewable resources.

2-As robotics become more prevelant in the home, I assume that there will be more and more automation in the house for lighting, heating and cooling which will do a much better job than a human to save energy.

How can technology be used in people’s houses to help with energy conservation?
1. Solar power is a prime example - people can rely on the power of the sun to use less electricity and fuel (or any other natural resources they are presently using to power their homes.)  If solar panels and solar power could be made more practical and more readily available, we could be saving a great deal.
2. Alternative fuels could help to reduce not only gasoline usage, but also home heating oil usage.  Advances in the design and manufacture of alternative fuels could help reduce the costs of implementing such technology, making it more practical for consumer use.

1. Feedback - A lot of the time, consumers may not realize how much energy devices use (like media devices such as tvs while in standby mode, etc). Devices that display how much energy an item is actually using may motivate users to chose lower consumption products or to unplug devices when they are done with them.
2. Time - People tend to run power hungry devices in the middle of the day, while the energy grid as a whole is experiencing a peak power demand. Smart devices could coordinate when they run or schedule themselves to be on during the nighttime, when electricity is cheaper. Dishwashers, for example, could be loaded after dinner and have clean dishes when you get up in the morning. ",

2. There's got to be some technology that is ""smart"". So a heater knows not to turn on when you open a window for fresh air. I know, it's called a thermostat! But sometimes when you have a thermostat set for a particular temp, and open a window to air out a room, the heat clicks on, even though you didn't want it to. Maybe there can be an electronic override or some sort of something that can determine when it's appropriate to turn the heater on.",
